* PIP
  * These methods cna generally be distinguished by two types: the ray casting and the winding number.
  * It need the edges of a polycon to evaluate a node is inside or iutside of this polygon.
* KNN classification exhibits several remarkable properties.
  * the classification is available in various fields,including data mining algorithms and artifficial intelligence(AI).
  * Containing a number of training data points and a test data point to evaluate the class of the test point.
